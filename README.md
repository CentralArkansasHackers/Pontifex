# üìñ Pontifex Cipher (Solitaire) ‚Äì Swift & Go Implementation

A cross-platform implementation of the **Pontifex Cipher** (aka **Solitaire**) from Neal Stephenson's *Cryptonomicon*, written in **Swift** and **Go**. This project demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt messages using a **deck of cards** as the cryptographic key.

---

## üîç **What is the Pontifex Cipher?**

The **Pontifex Cipher**, designed by Bruce Schneier for *Cryptonomicon*, is a manual cryptographic algorithm that uses a **deck of 54 playing cards** (52 standard + 2 Jokers) to generate a keystream. Each keystream value is combined with plaintext to produce ciphertext and vice versa.

It is notable for:
- Being **secure enough** for field use with just a deck of cards.
- Having **no reliance on computers**‚Äîa purely **manual** encryption system.
- Being **fun to use**‚Äîand a great introduction to cryptography.

If you haven't read *Cryptonomicon*, stop everything and go read it. Seriously. It's a masterful blend of historical fiction and modern-day cyberthriller that will forever change how you think about cryptography, privacy, and the digital age. Neal Stephenson weaves together WWII codebreaking, modern information security, and a grand adventure spanning generations. The Pontifex cipher is just one of many fascinating elements that make this book a must-read for any technology enthusiast.

```

### üé¥ **Initial Setup**

Before we begin, we need to assign values to each card in the deck:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class CardValues {
        Clubs(‚ô£Ô∏è): 1-13
        Diamonds(‚ô¶Ô∏è): 14-26
        Hearts(‚ô•Ô∏è): 27-39
        Spades(‚ô†Ô∏è): 40-52
        Jokers: 53
    }
    
    class Clubs {
        A‚ô£Ô∏è: 1
        2‚ô£Ô∏è: 2
        3‚ô£Ô∏è: 3
        ...
        J‚ô£Ô∏è: 11
        Q‚ô£Ô∏è: 12
        K‚ô£Ô∏è: 13
    }
    
    class Diamonds {
        A‚ô¶Ô∏è: 14
        2‚ô¶Ô∏è: 15
        3‚ô¶Ô∏è: 16
        ...
        J‚ô¶Ô∏è: 24
        Q‚ô¶Ô∏è: 25
        K‚ô¶Ô∏è: 26
    }
    
    class Hearts {
        A‚ô•Ô∏è: 27
        2‚ô•Ô∏è: 28
        3‚ô•Ô∏è: 29
        ...
        J‚ô•Ô∏è: 37
        Q‚ô•Ô∏è: 38
        K‚ô•Ô∏è: 39
    }
    
    class Spades {
        A‚ô†Ô∏è: 40
        2‚ô†Ô∏è: 41
        3‚ô†Ô∏è: 42
        ...
        J‚ô†Ô∏è: 50
        Q‚ô†Ô∏è: 51
        K‚ô†Ô∏è: 52
    }
    
    CardValues <|-- Clubs
    CardValues <|-- Diamonds
    CardValues <|-- Hearts
    CardValues <|-- Spades
```

### üîÑ **Keystream Generation Steps**

#### üìä **Step 1-2: Move the Jokers**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Deck as Card Deck
    Note over Deck: Initial state
    Note over Deck: ... 7‚ô•Ô∏è 4‚ô¶Ô∏è JOKER_A 9‚ô†Ô∏è ...
    Deck->>Deck: Move Joker A down 1 position
    Note over Deck: ... 7‚ô•Ô∏è 4‚ô¶Ô∏è 9‚ô†Ô∏è JOKER_A ...
    Deck->>Deck: Move Joker B down 2 positions
    Note over Deck: ... 10‚ô£Ô∏è JOKER_B 5‚ô¶Ô∏è Q‚ô•Ô∏è ...
    Note over Deck: becomes
    Note over Deck: ... 10‚ô£Ô∏è 5‚ô¶Ô∏è Q‚ô•Ô∏è JOKER_B ...
```

**Special cases:**
- If Joker A is at the bottom, it wraps to position 1 (just after the top card)
- If Joker B is at the bottom, it wraps to position 2
- If Joker B is second-to-last, it wraps to position 1

#### üìä **Step 3: Triple Cut**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Deck as Card Deck
    Note over Deck: Initial state
    Note over Deck: [ A B C D ] [ JOKER_A E F G JOKER_B ] [ H I J ]
    Note over Deck: First joker at position 5, Second joker at position 9
    
    Deck->>Deck: Identify three sections
    Note over Deck: Section 1: [ A B C D ] (before first joker)
    Note over Deck: Section 2: [ JOKER_A E F G JOKER_B ] (between and including jokers)
    Note over Deck: Section 3: [ H I J ] (after second joker)
    
    Deck->>Deck: Swap sections 1 and 3
    Note over Deck: After triple cut
    Note over Deck: [ H I J ] [ JOKER_A E F G JOKER_B ] [ A B C D ]
```

The order of the jokers doesn't matter - just find the topmost and bottommost joker.

#### üìä **Step 4: Count Cut**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Deck as Card Deck
    Note over Deck: Initial state
    Note over Deck: [ A B C D E ] [ 5‚ô£Ô∏è ]
    Note over Deck: Bottom card value = 5
    
    Deck->>Deck: Count 5 cards from top
    Note over Deck: [ A B C D E ] [ 5‚ô£Ô∏è ]
    Note over Deck: 1 2 3 4 5
    
    Deck->>Deck: Move counted cards before bottom card
    Note over Deck: After count cut
    Note over Deck: [ ] [ A B C D E ] [ 5‚ô£Ô∏è ]
```

The bottom card always stays at the bottom.

#### üìä **Step 5: Find Output Card**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    id1[Look at top card value] --> id2{Is value < deck size?}
    id2 -->|No| id3[Skip and restart process]
    id2 -->|Yes| id4[Count down that many cards]
    id4 --> id5[Look at the card at that position]
    id5 --> id6{Is it a joker?}
    id6 -->|Yes| id3
    id6 -->|No| id7[Convert card value to 1-26]
    id7 --> id8[Use as keystream value]
    
    style id1 fill:#d0e0f0
    style id8 fill:#f9d5e5
```

If the card value is > 26, subtract 26 to get a value between 1-26.

## üÉè **Manual Encryption Example With a Full Deck**

Let's walk through a complete manual encryption example with a full deck of cards. We'll encrypt the message: **"CRYPTONOMICON"**.

### üìã **Initial Deck Setup**

We'll use a "keyed" deck, which means we start with a pre-arranged order. In practice, this would be your secret key.

For this example, let's use this deck arrangement (cards listed from top to bottom):

```
A‚ô†Ô∏è, 2‚ô†Ô∏è, 3‚ô†Ô∏è, 4‚ô†Ô∏è, 5‚ô†Ô∏è, 6‚ô†Ô∏è, 7‚ô†Ô∏è, 8‚ô†Ô∏è, 9‚ô†Ô∏è, 10‚ô†Ô∏è, J‚ô†Ô∏è, Q‚ô†Ô∏è, K‚ô†Ô∏è, 
A‚ô•Ô∏è, 2‚ô•Ô∏è, 3‚ô•Ô∏è, 4‚ô•Ô∏è, 5‚ô•Ô∏è, 6‚ô•Ô∏è, 7‚ô•Ô∏è, 8‚ô•Ô∏è, 9‚ô•Ô∏è, 10‚ô•Ô∏è, J‚ô•Ô∏è, Q‚ô•Ô∏è, K‚ô•Ô∏è, 
A‚ô¶Ô∏è, 2‚ô¶Ô∏è, 3‚ô¶Ô∏è, 4‚ô¶Ô∏è, 5‚ô¶Ô∏è, 6‚ô¶Ô∏è, 7‚ô¶Ô∏è, 8‚ô¶Ô∏è, 9‚ô¶Ô∏è, 10‚ô¶Ô∏è, J‚ô¶Ô∏è, Q‚ô¶Ô∏è, K‚ô¶Ô∏è, 
A‚ô£Ô∏è, 2‚ô£Ô∏è, 3‚ô£Ô∏è, 4‚ô£Ô∏è, 5‚ô£Ô∏è, 6‚ô£Ô∏è, 7‚ô£Ô∏è, 8‚ô£Ô∏è, 9‚ô£Ô∏è, 10‚ô£Ô∏è, J‚ô£Ô∏è, Q‚ô£Ô∏è, K‚ô£Ô∏è, 
JOKER_A, JOKER_B
```

### üìù **The Encryption Process: Step by Step**

Here's a timeline view of how the first few letters get encrypted:

```mermaid
gantt
    title Encrypting "CRYPTONOMICON" - First Three Letters
    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
    section C (value 3)
    Move Joker A           :a1, 2023-01-01, 1d
    Move Joker B           :a2, after a1, 1d
    Triple Cut             :a3, after a2, 1d
    Count Cut              :a4, after a3, 1d
    Get Output (21)        :a5, after a4, 1d
    C(3) + 21 = 24 = X     :milestone, after a5, 0d
    
    section R (value 18)
    Move Joker A           :b1, after a5, 1d
    Move Joker B           :b2, after b1, 1d
    Triple Cut             :b3, after b2, 1d
    Count Cut              :b4, after b3, 1d
    Get Output (4)         :b5, after b4, 1d
    R(18) + 4 = 22 = V     :milestone, after b5, 0d
    
    section Y (value 25)
    Move Joker A           :c1, after b5, 1d
    Move Joker B           :c2, after c1, 1d
    Triple Cut             :c3, after c2, 1d
    Count Cut              :c4, after c3, 1d
    Get Output (6)         :c5, after c4, 1d
    Y(25) + 6 = 31 ‚Üí 5 = E :milestone, after c5, 0d
```

Continuing this process for each letter, we'll eventually get a complete ciphertext. The full calculation would be:

| Letter | Value | Keystream | Sum | Ciphertext |
|--------|-------|-----------|-----|------------|
| C      | 3     | 21        | 24  | X          |
| R      | 18    | 4         | 22  | V          |
| Y      | 25    | 6         | 31‚Üí5| E          |
| P      | 16    | 13        | 29‚Üí3| C          |
| T      | 20    | 22        | 42‚Üí16| P         |
| O      | 15    | 17        | 32‚Üí6| F          |
| N      | 14    | 24        | 38‚Üí12| L         |
| O      | 15    | 8         | 23  | W          |
| M      | 13    | 19        | 32‚Üí6| F          |
| I      | 9     | 5         | 14  | N          |
| C      | 3     | 11        | 14  | N          |
| O      | 15    | 10        | 25  | Y          |
| N      | 14    | 15        | 29‚Üí3| C          |

So "CRYPTONOMICON" encrypts to "**XVECPFLWFNNYC**"

### üìù **Decryption Process**

To decrypt, we would:
1. Start with the same initial deck arrangement
2. Generate the same keystream
3. Subtract each keystream value from the corresponding ciphertext letter value
4. Add 26 if the result is less than 1

For example, to decrypt the first letter "X":
- X = 24
- Keystream = 21
- 24 - 21 = 3
- 3 = C

Repeating for each letter would give us back "CRYPTONOMICON".

## üéÆ **Additional Tips for Manual Use**

If you're using physical cards:

1. **Mark your jokers** distinctly as "A" and "B" to avoid confusion
2. **Practice the count cut** as it's the trickiest part for beginners
3. **Keep track of your place** in the algorithm‚Äîmissing a step ruins the encryption
4. **Work on a clean surface** where cards can be neatly arranged in rows
5. For longer messages, consider **encrypting in blocks of 5 letters**

Remember that the security of the cipher depends on:
- Keeping your initial deck arrangement secret
- Properly performing each step of the algorithm
- Not reusing the same deck arrangement for multiple messages

## üìö **Read *Cryptonomicon***

For those fascinated by cryptography, history, and amazing storytelling, Neal Stephenson's *Cryptonomicon* is a must-read. It dives deep into WWII cryptography, modern infosec, and features **one of the best depictions of a realistic cipher in fiction**.

The book brilliantly interweaves two timelines:
- World War II era with mathematicians and codebreakers working at Bletchley Park
- Modern-day hackers and entrepreneurs building a data haven

Beyond the fascinating cryptography concepts, the book explores themes of privacy, information security, digital currency (predating Bitcoin), and the long reach of history into the present. It's not just a novel about codes‚Äîit's about how information shapes our world.
